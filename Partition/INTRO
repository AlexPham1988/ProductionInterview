Dynamic Programming problem which can be considered in multithreading and big data processing. When the input data is too large, we should divide them into smalled part call "chunks". Data inside each chunks should be balance in order to make sure the entire process to executed properly.

Consider the case of imbalance chunks can lead to deamon processes. It mean some processes are assigned with "smaller" job and completed them first. Those which have to wait for long time for other processes with "large" job. Causing them become "idle"

To avoid such kind of problems, we need to make sure the jobs are assign equally for all processes. This algirithm can help. Let so it with Python
